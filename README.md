The goal of this project is to use puzzle codes (such as morse code, barcode, and basic substitution ciphers) to convert messages into art.

To run:
This is a basic flask app, most of the logic lives in the python file puzzle-art.py. Run with 'python puzzle-art.py' - this will run a local server at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
